    <h2>French fries ecipe</h2>
    <p>Crispy, golden fries seasoned with a flavorful blend of herbs and spices.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Â½ cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon</li>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time</li>
        <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
